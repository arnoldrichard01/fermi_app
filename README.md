# FERMI - ENERGY LEVEL CALCULATOR 
A simple fermi energy level calculator that collects denisty, atomic mass and valency and calculates the fermi level of that metal 

# FEATURES 
1. Valency Slider
2. Realtime- Comparison Graph with other common metals

# PYTHON LIBRARIES USED:
1. Matplot
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Streamlit
5. sys

# FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
1. Pre Define density and atomic mass values of all metals in the periodic table
2. Animations for easy understanding of fermi level
3. Selector based (just select the metal and the fermi energy is calculated)
